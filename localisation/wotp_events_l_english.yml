 kremlin.1.t:0 "Arrival"

 kremlin.1.a:0 "Continue the operation. We have no time to waste."
 kremlin.1.b:0 "§GFortunately, we are prepared for such things...§!"
 kremlin.2.t:0 "Lair of the Beast"
 kremlin.2.d:0 "We managed to reach the cabinets, where all the bloody killers seat... But you caught yourself thinking of your agents last reports. Something is not right at all..."
 kremlin.2.a:0 "To late to think. We need to act, and do it quickly"
 kremlin.3.t:0 "Lair of the Beast"
 kremlin.3.d:0 "We managed to reach the cabinets, where all the bloody killers seat... Our man report about some unexpected NKVD agents, eliminated nice and clean. Everything is going rather well."

 kremlin.3.b:0 "§GRequest reserve agents to check prepared gateways and caches again.§!"
 kremlin.4.t:0 "Failure"
 kremlin.4.d:0 "Missing agents, searched caches, sudden plan changes it was obvious something is not right at all. NKVD was always one step ahead. Ready for all our tricks. We lost not just battle, but war..."
 kremlin.4.a:0 "The end is nigh..."
 kremlin.5.t:0 "Escape"
 kremlin.5.d:0 "When the last step was needed to be made it was clear - we were caught in an ambush. NKVD rats had evacuated Stalin and some other importand persons in advance, and were waiting for us. We can only take a fight and try to escape now."
 kremlin.5.a:0 "Crap! Hope at least half will get back..."
 kremlin.6.t:0 "Success"
 kremlin.6.d:0 "Everything passed pretty smooth. Reserve agents took a fight with a portion of NKVD staff trying to ambush us near caches and escape ways, creating some unneeded noise, however securing the success of an operation. Targets are eliminated and important documents stolen right from the lair of the Red Devil. A new dawn for Russia has come."
 kremlin.6.a:0 "Who dares, wins..."
 kremlin.7.t:0 "Trial of the FNS"
 kremlin.7.d:0 "Purge proving itself quite useful as a huge conspirators network called FNS was found. With such great reserves of equipment, people and connections, it was hard to understand how it could be declassified. Looks like last preparations had been made and they were ready to go. Hopefully we managed to find them before it was too late."
 kremlin.7.a:0 "We lost the war. But we did it with honor."
 kremlin.8.t:0 "Last Battle"
 kremlin.8.d:0 "Maybe our attempt to make everything smoothly was more like garbage from the begining, but we have a Plan B. Most of key agents and our important connections are still alive.

 kremlin.8.a:0 "For freedom! For Fatherland!"
 kremlin.9.t:0 "New Order"
 kremlin.9.d:0 "As you managed to steal all important documents and remove key figures of Communist Party, it is time to secure your power in a created turmoil. While some powerful party members are fighting for power over a crumbling government, we can easily proclaim ourselves a legitimate government and win people's support. Documents we found will help us to accuse commies of their crimes drive people further from them."
 kremlin.9.a:0 "Praise the freedom! Once and forever!"
 kremlin.11.t:0 "Fascist Crackdown"
